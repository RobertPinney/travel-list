Created in React, this site is designed with a retro style to assist in the process of packing for a trip.

More specifically the user is able to add quantities of items to a list that need to be packed, and the mark them off as they are packed.

This program helped me to develope skills such as how to build list components and then how to build interactive search and sort functions.
